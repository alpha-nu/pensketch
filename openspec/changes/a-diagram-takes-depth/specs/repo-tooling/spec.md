# repo-tooling — Delta Specification

> Two budgets move for depth, in one step, sized from a built rehearsal of

> in a-diagram-takes-depth/design.md D7 and beside the numbers in
> `tools/check-size.mjs`.

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Size budgets are enforced
`tools/check-size.mjs` SHALL gzip the built ESM entry of each published entry
point and fail (non-zero exit, printing actual vs budget) when
`@pensketch/core` exceeds 5120 bytes, `@pensketch/core/check` exceeds 3648
bytes, `@pensketch/core/server` exceeds 4992 bytes, `@pensketch/react` exceeds
2048 bytes, or `@pensketch/animation` exceeds 768 bytes min+gzip. Each
published entry SHALL be a self-contained
file: build-time code splitting SHALL be off, because a shared chunk makes an
entry's budget measure a re-export rather than the code it stands for. It
SHALL also fail when the size printed in the README's comparison table is not
the size the build produces, since a figure a reader is invited to compare
against another project is a derived number, and every other derived number in
this repository is held to its source by a gate rather than by memory.
`@pensketch/mcp` SHALL NOT carry a byte budget —
it is spawned, never bundled into a page — but its packed tarball size SHALL
be reported at build time, because a WebAssembly rasterizer and an embedded
font dominate it and a user fetching it through `npx` waits for every byte.

A budget SHALL be raised deliberately and in advance of the work that needs
the room, in one step, with the measured need recorded where the number is
declared. It SHALL NOT be raised at a failing gate to make that gate pass: a
budget corrected after the fact records only that something grew, where one
corrected before records what was decided and on what evidence.

#### Scenario: Budget breach
- **WHEN** a change pushes core's min+gzip ESM output over 5120 bytes
- **THEN** `npm run size` fails and CI goes red

#### Scenario: Each subpath is held separately
- **WHEN** either subpath exceeds its own budget
- **THEN** `npm run size` fails, and the root entry's budget is unaffected either way

#### Scenario: A published comparison cannot go stale
- **WHEN** an entry grows and the README still prints the size it had before
- **THEN** `npm run size` fails, naming both numbers, rather than leaving the repository's front page to be corrected at release time

#### Scenario: A budget moves before the code does
- **WHEN** a change knows from a prototype that a feature will not fit an entry's budget
- **THEN** the budget is raised in its own commit, before the feature is written, carrying the measurement that justifies the new number

#### Scenario: The server's download weight is visible
- **WHEN** `@pensketch/mcp` is packed
- **THEN** its tarball size is reported, so the wait an `npx` user pays for is a known number rather than an accident

#### Scenario: A drawing feature is caught in the entry that carries it
- **WHEN** a feature is added to `draw` and only the root entry is measured
- **THEN** `@pensketch/core/server` is measured too and fails on its own account, because it bundles its own copy of the renderer and pays for the feature whether or not anyone imports it
